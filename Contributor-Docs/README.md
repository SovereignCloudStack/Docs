### Proposal to improve (Just my two cents)

- reduce usage of mailing lists drastically
- reduce amount of mailing lists
- use single source of annoucement
- don't spam the mailing lists with complete annoucements, but rather the link to the annoucement!
- provide ONE single URL for all services with proper subdomains:
  - nextcloud.sovereignit.de
  - lists.sovereignit.de
  - jitsi.sovereignit.de
  - sovereignit.de (website)
  - I've never understood why there is scs.community and scs.sovereignit.de
- I would love to have a single tool for chat and video calls (slack, zulip, rocket chat, mattermost, element matrix, microsoft teams, i don't care)
- overall documentation is too much distributed. I would expect this "https://scs.community/docs/contributor/" to be available as a menu point directly in "https://scs.community/". AND: I would expect it to be in the same design style. Would make things feel much more smooth.
- discussion point: add an "onboarding" channel in the desired instant messaging tool
- tell me how i can help to organize stuff, happy to contribute!
- there has been done a lot of work by you guys which is really great. And even thouh I critisied a lot, I would still say thank you for your hard work. It's hard to write good documentation, your's is very good!

### ToDo's

Based on the discussion within https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/pull/58.

- [ ] establish a Community Board and discuss proposals on a montly basis
- [ ] find a tool (Jekyll framework maybe) to deliver the Docs repo as a website
- [ ] discuss the meaningfullness of an onboarding channel in the desired instant messaging tool
- [ ] Having a single URL for all services?
